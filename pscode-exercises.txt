// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
	
#Prompt user for number and print if number is odd or even
Enter number:
define number

define even number
if number % 2 == 0
	True
else:
	False

if even number:
	print("The number is even.")
else:
	print("The number is odd.")


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.
a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

#Prompt user for 5 numbers
print ("Enter number 1:  ")
print ("Enter number 2:  ")
print ("Enter number 3:  ")
print ("Enter number 4:  ")
print ("Enter number 5:  ")

# Add numbers together 
# Divide to find average
(sum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5)
(average = sum/5)

#Find the minimum and maximum number
#I do not like this so I need to brush up on  
#lists and if else before actually trying to code this
if num1 < num2:
   num1 = minimum
   elif num1 = maximum
     if num2 < num3:
        num2 = minimum
        elif num2 = maximum
          if num3 < num4:
             num3 = minimum
          elif num3 = maximum
             if num4 < num5:
                num4 = minimum
else:
   num4 = maximum


   average = sum 
   output "The average is ", average
   output "The smallest number is ", min
   output "The largest number is ", max
stop
